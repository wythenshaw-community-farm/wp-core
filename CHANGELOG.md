# Changelog

This file documents all the changes to the project for each release.


## How to use this file

This change log contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

This files is based on the guidelines found at http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/, but in summary, you should have a 
section for each version (even yanked versions), and included in that a section for anything `Added`, `Changed` and/or
`Removed`.

To add changes tof a new version, simply add the changes to the [Unreleased] section at the top of the file, as you make 
them.  Once you're ready to release, simply rename the [Unreleased] section to the version number being released, and 
set the date of the release, and then add a new [Unreleased] section with the `Added`, `Changed` and `Removed` 
sub-sections.
